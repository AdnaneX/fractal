## What is Fractal?

Fractal provides a presentation and transformation layer for complex data output, the like found in RESTful 
APIs, and works really well with JSON.

## Goals

* Create a "barrier" between source data and output, so schema changes do not effect users
* Systematic type-casting of data, to avoid foreach()ing through and (bool)ing everything
* Embed (or nest) relationships for complex data structures
* Support the pagination of data results, for small and large data sets alike
* Generally ease the subtle complexities of outputting data in a non-trivial API
